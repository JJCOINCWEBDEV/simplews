This example writes the WSDL into disk so that the client needs not use the
simplews library, just load the WSDL. This approach would work with clients
implemented on any other language that supports SOAP and loading WSDL files.

It also extends the SimpleWS to ilustrate how to use class and instance
variables and constants.
